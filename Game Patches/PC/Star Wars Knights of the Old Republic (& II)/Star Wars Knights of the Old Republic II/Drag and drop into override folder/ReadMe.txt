=================================


DESCRIPTION:

I've always wanted to make a lightsaber hilt mod, but I never liked how most people would use hilts from the movies. Or if it's not that, there has to be a fancy hilt for every single different color. Well what I did here is fairly simple and should intrigue even the most skeptical of saber mod downloaders.

I remade the standard game hilts so that they look like higher definition versions of the old ones. A lot of people complained how they looked like tin cans - they still are, but with higher polygons.

There are several subfolders which you can install -

Saber Models - This folder contains the higher polygon version hilts only. No other modifications made.

Darth Nihilus Saber - Contains the files used for adding Darth Nihilus' saber to the game. Override's Malak's Lightsaber model since it doesn't have much of a use in this game.

Fixed Icons and colors - Fixes the colors in the weapon icons for the cyan and bronze/orange lightsabers. It also restores the unused bronze lightsaber crystal and distinguishes between the orange and bronze lightsaber colors (previously, they both used the same Heart of the Guardian saber color)

Fixed Loot scripts - These loot scripts will allow the orange, bronze, silver and cyan crystals to appear more often. Previously, the bronze crystal wouldn't appear at all, and apparently neither would the cyan crystal. This should be fixed now.



COMPATIBILITY:

This is obviously not going to be compatible with any other saber mods.
